            <h4 >The quest for bread within garbage</h4>

            <p class="inhirit-once">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iran is among the richest countries in world in terms of natural resources, yet 60% of the population live under the poverty line. Among the many reasons of this poverty are unequal distribution of wealth and the inadequate facilities in impoverished areas. One of these impoverished areas is a village called Shurak, in norther Khorasan province. The village hosts 150 families one-third of which make their livings through collecting garbage in landfills. Most people who collect garbage were not able to afford education and barely graduated high school. The nearest school is within a 36-kilometer distance from the village and most people are not able to afford its 500,000-tomans tuition fee. Drying up of springs and qanats and subsequent dry-up of the farmlands mostly as a reason of climate change is another reason that they have lost their jobs and consequently become poor.
                Ahmad is one of the garbage collectors. He is 30 and father of 3 children and has been collecting garbage for nearly 13 years. His sole source of income is collecting recyclables.  He earns less than 2 dollars from an 8-hour night work. He and other villagers have to work at night as the garbage trucks bring the garbage from the city to the landfill at nights. The temperature at nights may drop to minus 15 degrees Celsius in winters along with snowfall. Another reason for the night work is the risk of incineration of garbage and consequent loss of recyclables in the next mornings. Therefore, they have no choice but working at nights in order to maintain the hope for finding recyclables.
                Ahmad’s daughter has finished the fifth grade. In order to continue her education, she needs to be sent to a boarding school. However, Ahmad cannot afford a boarding school and this simply means a farewell to further education of her daughter.
                In recent years, international embargos on Iran has had a significant impact on consumer buying power which in turn has led to a significant drop in the amount of recyclables and consequent increased hardships of life for Ahmad and the other villagers. Ahmad’s greatest concern is that one day his son has to pursue his family career: collecting recyclables.
